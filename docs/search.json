You’ll get the most out of this session if you are familiar with:\nthe basics of R Markdown1,\nthe RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and\nGitHub via the RStudio IDE.\n\nYou won’t have to use GitHub for the session, but many of tools we’ll use integrate nicely with version control via GitHub. To get started, complete these installation instructions, then test your connection between GitHub and RStudio following these steps.2.\nYou’ll also need to install the following packages:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"xaringan\", \"distill\", \"palmerpenguins\"))\n\n\n\n\nLinks\nLink to this website: https://rstd.io/tip\nSlides\nAcknowledgments\nThis is website made with the distill package and a custom theme by Alison Hill & Desirée De Leon.\n\nsee https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html for a refresher↩︎\nWe strongly recommend that if you are not already a fluent GitHub user you choose HTTPS over SSH.↩︎\n",
